# individual_project_1

This is a single-page personal website, mainly talking about my status and hobbies, sharing pictures I took during trips.

The website is integrated with css and bootstrap to become mobile responsive. For example, I used the grid system of bootstrap to align the three main themes in the travel section in the website. Whe the width of the window is smaller than 768px, the alignment of the the themes changes from row to column. The container of the themes extends vertically at the same time using css @media. 

With animate.css and jQuery, it can response to centain events. The facebook and integram icon infinitely act like rubberband; if click the 'know more me' button, text will slide up, etc.
